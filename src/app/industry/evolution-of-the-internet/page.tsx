  {
    year: "1960s",
    title: "ARPANET",
    body: "The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) laid the foundation for what would become the internet. Funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, it connected research institutions using packet switching and set the stage for global digital communication. These early networks relied on copper and leased telephone lines, planting the seed for the physical infrastructure industry.",
  },
  {
    year: "1980s",
    title: "TCP/IP Standardization",
    body: "The adoption of TCP/IP as the standard protocol suite unified disparate networks into a single, interoperable system. This transition enabled reliable data transmission across different network types and paved the way for the internet's commercialization. Infrastructure builders began designing routes and facilities to support higher bandwidth and longer distances.",
  },
  {
    year: "1990s",
    title: "Commercial Internet & Fiber Backbone Expansion",
    body: "The World Wide Web and the lifting of commercial restrictions accelerated internet growth. Fiber optic backbone networks replaced older copper routes, delivering vastly higher capacity and lower latency. Carriers and contractors built long-haul routes connecting major cities, establishing the core architecture still in use today.",
  },
  {
    year: "2000s",
    title: "Broadband & Metro Growth",
    body: "Broadband adoption spread to homes and businesses through DSL, cable, and early fiber deployments. Metro-area fiber networks expanded to serve enterprises, data centers, and carrier interconnection points. Underground and aerial construction crews deployed conduit and cable at scale to meet rising demand.",
  },
  {
    year: "2010s",
    title: "FTTH & Gigabit Networks",
    body: "Fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-premise became the gold standard for last-mile connectivity. Municipal and carrier projects brought gigabit speeds to communities across the United States. Horizontal directional drilling, microtrenching, and aerial builds accelerated deployment while minimizing disruption.",
  },
  {
    year: "2020s",
    title: "Nationwide Fiber Acceleration",
    body: "Federal and state broadband initiatives, along with private investment, are driving nationwide fiber expansion. Backbone diversification, data center growth, and 5G backhaul are increasing demand for carrier-grade construction. Today's fiber infrastructure supports everything from remote work to real-time applications.",

            The history of the internet is the history of physical infrastructure. Each milestone—from early packet networks to today&apos;s fiber backbones—required construction crews, engineers, and contractors to install cable, conduit, and equipment. Understanding that evolution helps contextualize the role of fiber infrastructure in building the next generation of connectivity.
