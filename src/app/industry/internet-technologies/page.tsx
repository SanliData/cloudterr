    body: "Optical fiber forms the physical medium for light-based data transmission. Single-mode fiber supports long-haul and high-capacity applications; multi-mode fiber serves shorter distances in premises and data centers. Ribbon and high-count configurations enable dense cabling for backbone and distribution segments.",

    items: ["GPON", "XGS-PON", "OLT", "ONT"],
    body: "PON architectures use passive splitters to distribute a single OLT port to multiple ONTs. GPON provides gigabit-class symmetric and asymmetric access; XGS-PON extends that to 10 Gbps symmetric. OLT equipment resides in the central office or hub; ONTs terminate at the customer premise.",

    items: ["DWDM", "CWDM", "100G / 400G / 800G Transmission"],
    body: "Wavelength division multiplexing increases fiber capacity by carrying multiple signals on distinct wavelengths. DWDM uses closely spaced channels for long-haul and data center links; CWDM suits shorter metro distances. Line-side interfaces support 100G, 400G, and 800G coherent transmission for backbone routes.",

Conduit systems protect cable from moisture and mechanical damage. Cable blowing and pulling are the primary methods for placing fiber inside conduit.",

            All advanced transmission systems—from coherent 400G to GPON—depend on properly installed underground and aerial fiber infrastructure. OSP construction quality, splicing precision, restoration standards, and documentation practices directly affect signal integrity and long-term reliability. Cloud Communication LLC provides the construction layer that makes these technologies operational in the field.
